# dom-testing-library with ANYTHING

Anything you can render to the DOM, you can test with dom-testing-library.

This repo is a bunch of simple examples of using `dom-testing-library` to test
a `Counter` component in various frameworks. If your framework of choice is not
listed here, please add it!

## Contributing

I want to keep things as simple as possible, but I also want to be true to
what's typical for a given framework. If your framework strongly encourages the
use of TypeScript for example, then please feel free to use TypeScript (Jest
should already be configured to pick it up properly).

If Jest is not the testing framework of choice for your web framework, I'd still
prefer to stick with Jest. Hopefully it shouldn't make much of a difference for
the test itself.

Try really hard to keep everything in a single file, even if that means
authoring your component in a slightly non-typical way.
